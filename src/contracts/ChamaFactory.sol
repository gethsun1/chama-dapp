/**
 * @title ChamaFactory
 * @dev A decentralized savings system (Chama) factory implementing a ROCSA-based group savings model.
 * This version penalizes members who default on their contributions by slashing a percentage of their deposit,
 * with the collected penalties added to the payout for the scheduled recipient.
 *
 * Features:
 *  - Creation of a Chama with specific parameters.
 *  - Member enrollment with duplicate membership prevention.
 *  - Cycle-based contribution tracking with time-bound contribution windows.
 *  - Automatic penalty enforcement for defaulting members.
 *  - Round-robin payout execution that aggregates contributions and penalties.
 *  - Reentrancy protection during payout operations.
