The core of Chama Dapp is the ChamaFactory smart contract, which manages the creation of Chamas, joining, contributions, and payouts. Key functionalities include:

createChama: Initializes a new Chama with specified parameters.

joinChama: Lets users join a Chama by providing the required deposit.

contribute: Enables members to contribute the defined amount for the current cycle.

payout: Executes payouts to members in a round-robin fashion.

isMember: Verifies membership of an address within a specific Chama.


The smart contract is written in Solidity (v0.8.0) and deployed on the Scroll Sepolia Testnet.
