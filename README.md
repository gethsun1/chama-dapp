## 🏗️ Smart Contract Architecture

The core of Chama Dapp is the [**ChamaFactory**](https://github.com/gethsun1/chama-dapp/blob/main/src/contracts/ChamaFactory.sol) smart contract. Developed in Solidity (v0.8.26), it implements a decentralized savings model that automates the management of group savings with strict on-chain governance.

### Key Functions & Sample Snippets

#### 1. Creating a Chama

The `createChama` function initializes a new savings group with all necessary parameters. It ensures that key requirements are met (e.g., non-zero deposit and contribution amounts) and logs an event for on-chain transparency.

```solidity
function createChama(
    string memory _name,
    string memory _description,
    uint256 _depositAmount,
    uint256 _contributionAmount,
    uint256 _penalty,
    uint256 _maxMembers,
    uint256 _cycleDuration
) external returns (uint256) {
    require(_maxMembers > 0, "Max members must be > 0");
    require(_depositAmount > 0, "Deposit amount must be > 0");
    require(_contributionAmount > 0, "Contribution amount must be > 0");

    chamaCount++;
    Chama storage newChama = chamas[chamaCount];
    newChama.id = chamaCount;
    newChama.creator = msg.sender;
    newChama.name = _name;
    newChama.description = _description;
    newChama.depositAmount = _depositAmount;
    newChama.contributionAmount = _contributionAmount;
    newChama.penalty = _penalty;
    newChama.maxMembers = _maxMembers;
    newChama.cycleDuration = _cycleDuration;
    newChama.currentRound = 1;
    newChama.currentCycle = 1;
    newChama.nextCycleStart = block.timestamp + _cycleDuration;
    newChama.isActive = true;

    emit ChamaCreated(chamaCount, _name, msg.sender);
    return chamaCount;
}
```

#### 2. Joining a Chama

The `joinChama` function allows users to join an active Chama by sending the exact deposit amount. It prevents duplicate membership and ensures the Chama is not already full.

```solidity
function joinChama(uint256 _chamaId) external payable {
    Chama storage chama = chamas[_chamaId];
    require(chama.isActive, "Chama is not active");
    require(chama.membersCount < chama.maxMembers, "Chama is full");
    require(msg.value == chama.depositAmount, "Incorrect deposit amount");
    require(!isMember(_chamaId, msg.sender), "Already a member");

    chama.members.push(msg.sender);
    chama.membersCount++;
    memberDeposit[_chamaId][msg.sender] = chama.depositAmount;
    emit JoinedChama(_chamaId, msg.sender);
}
```

#### 3. Making Contributions & Payouts

The contract also handles periodic contributions and automated payouts. Contributions are checked against the schedule, and if a member defaults, a penalty is applied. Payouts are executed in a round‑robin fashion.

```solidity
function contribute(uint256 _chamaId) external payable {
    Chama storage chama = chamas[_chamaId];
    require(chama.isActive, "Chama is not active");
    require(isMember(_chamaId, msg.sender), "Not a member of this Chama");
    require(msg.value == chama.contributionAmount, "Incorrect contribution amount");
    require(block.timestamp < chama.nextCycleStart, "Contribution period over for current cycle");
    require(!contributions[_chamaId][chama.currentCycle][msg.sender], "Contribution already made for current cycle");

    contributions[_chamaId][chama.currentCycle][msg.sender] = true;
    emit ContributionMade(_chamaId, chama.currentCycle, msg.sender, msg.value);
}
```

*Note: Additional functions (such as `payout` and internal calculations) ensure that the smart contract robustly handles all group savings operations while protecting against reentrancy and other common attacks.*
